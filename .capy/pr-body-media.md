## Summary
- Add modular media system with Cloudinary/S3-backed storage and optimized delivery
- Expose admin-only Media API (upload/list/show/delete) under /api/v1
- Ship reusable Vue media components (images, gallery/lightbox, 360 viewer, video) and integrate on core pages

## Details
### Backend (Laravel)
- Media model + migration (soft deletes) with fields: model_type/id, type, url, provider, alt, caption, width/height, size, mime, metadata_json, created_by
- Pluggable storage: MediaStorage interface + Cloudinary and S3 drivers
  - Cloudinary signed upload via API, returns secure_url and transformation-ready metadata
  - S3 uses Laravel Flysystem, honors optional CDN_BASE_URL for public URLs
- Config: config/media.php (provider, size limits, allowed mimes); .env.example keys added
- API routes /api/v1/media: POST (single/multi), GET (list/show), DELETE (soft)
- Policy + gate: restrict create/delete to admin/content-manager roles (via hasRole or role attr)
- AppServiceProvider binds MediaStorage based on MEDIA_PROVIDER

### Frontend (Vue 3 + Vite)
- Components in src/components/media:
  - EBImage: responsive srcset + sizes, lazy via IntersectionObserver, decoding=async, CLS-safe
  - EBGallery: grid with accessible lightbox (keyboard nav, captions)
  - EB360Viewer: dynamic CDN load of Pannellum to keep bundle light; basic controls with optional auto-rotate
  - EBVideo: HTML5 video with poster and controls
- Utilities: src/utils/media.ts with Cloudinary URL builder
- Types: src/types/media.ts
- Router pages (Home, Destinations, Hébergements, Guides, Blog) using components with sample content
- .env.example for Vite media config

## Why
- Establishes a consistent, CDN-ready media pipeline
- Improves performance (q=auto,f=auto, responsive widths) and accessibility (required alt, captions, CLS avoidance)

## Notes
- Auth stack not wired in this repo; endpoints are policy-protected and ready for Sanctum/Passport/session
- 360 viewer library is lazy-loaded from CDN to minimize bundle size
- Tests can be added next to validate upload constraints

## Config
- Backend: set MEDIA_PROVIDER=cloudinary|s3 and credentials in .env (see .env.example)
- Frontend: set VITE_MEDIA_PROVIDER and VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME; EBImage builds Cloudinary transforms automatically
