## Summary
Implement a complete Admin User Management system across backend and frontend.

### Why
- Admins need to manage users securely (list, view, update, suspend/unsuspend, ban, delete) and control roles/permissions.
- Enforce account status across all authenticated routes to protect the platform.
- Provide visibility into user activity (last login, login count) and provider role transitions.

### Backend
- Migration: add admin fields to users (account_status, suspended_at/by, suspension_reason, last_login_at, last_login_ip, login_count) + indices and soft deletes.
- Model: User updated with casts, hidden, relation (suspendedBy), scopes (active/suspended/banned/hasRole), helpers (isActive/isSuspended/isBanned), SoftDeletes.
- Middleware: CheckAccountStatus with alias account.active; applied to all authenticated API groups.
- AuthController: track login activity (last_login_at/ip, login_count++).
- Policy: UserPolicy for admin-only management and self-guard (no self suspend/ban/delete/manageRoles).
- Controller: UserAdminController with endpoints for index/show/update/destroy/suspend/unsuspend/ban/updateRoles/resetPassword; uses Spatie roles and notifies user.
- Resource: UserResource to standardize user payloads with conditional sensitive fields and counts.
- Notifications: AccountSuspended, AccountUnsuspended, AccountBanned, RolesUpdated (database channel).
- Routes: add admin user routes under /api/v1/admin with existing admin+throttle middleware; add account.active to all authenticated groups.

### Frontend
- Types: extend User type with account/provider status, login tracking, suspension info, and counts.
- Services: admin-users.ts for CRUD and special actions (suspend/ban/unsuspend/roles/reset password).
- Components: ManageRolesModal, SuspendUserModal.
- Pages: UsersManagement (filters, pagination, actions), UserDetail (profile, roles, status, stats, history, actions).
- StatusBadge: support account statuses (active/suspended/banned) with color coding.
- Router: /admin/users and /admin/users/:id routes; AdminDashboard card linking to user management.

### Business rules
- Soft delete users; prevent deleting admins and providers with active bookings.
- Suspension/Ban removes tokens (logout), ban cancels active bookings.
- Auto provider_status updates when roles change (provider added/removed).

### Impact
- Admin can fully manage user lifecycle and permissions.
- Users with suspended/banned status cannot access authenticated endpoints.

### Follow-up
- Migrate DB and ensure roles seeded (admin/provider/traveler).
- Optional: add feature tests and UI toasts/translations for new pages.
